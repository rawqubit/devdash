## Design Approach: Modern Minimalist with Gradient Accents

**Design Movement:** Contemporary Minimalism with Glassmorphism

**Core Principles:**
1. **Clarity through Simplicity**: Minimal visual noise, maximum content focus
2. **Depth via Layering**: Subtle glass-effect cards with layered backgrounds
3. **Motion as Communication**: Smooth transitions guide user attention
4. **Monochromatic Base with Accent**: Dark background with vibrant gradient accents (cyan-to-purple)

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Background**: Deep charcoal (#0f172a) - professional, non-distracting
- **Accent Gradient**: Cyan (#06b6d4) → Purple (#a855f7) - modern, energetic
- **Text**: Off-white (#f1f5f9) for primary, slate-400 (#94a3b8) for secondary
- **Glass Effect**: Semi-transparent white overlays (10-15% opacity) for card backgrounds

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric hero section with diagonal dividers
- Left-aligned content with right-side visual elements
- Staggered project cards with hover lift effects
- Sidebar navigation for quick access

**Signature Elements:**
1. Animated gradient border on featured project card
2. Floating particle/orb background animation
3. Glassmorphic cards with subtle blur backdrop

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Hover states reveal subtle shadows and slight scale increases
- Click-through animations are smooth and purposeful
- Loading states use gradient animations

**Animation:**
- Fade-in on scroll for project cards
- Smooth hover scale (1.02x) with shadow depth increase
- Gradient animation on featured project border (3s loop)
- Floating particles in background (very subtle, 15-20s loop)

**Typography System:**
- **Display**: "Geist" or "Space Grotesk" (bold, geometric) for headings
- **Body**: "Inter" (clean, readable) for content
- **Hierarchy**: 3.5rem (h1), 2rem (h2), 1.25rem (h3), 1rem (body)
- **Font Weight**: 700 for headings, 500 for subheadings, 400 for body

This design positions the portfolio as **modern, professional, and forward-thinking**—perfect for attracting GitHub stars and showcasing technical expertise.
